/**
 * This class will act as a data type. Similar to others like String and int. 
 * 
 * The purpose of this data type is to store a String and int together; a key-value pair. 
 * Kind of like the two values stored together in a HashMap. However unlike the 
 * values stored in a HashMap, the only combination of data types that can be
 * stored together are an int and a String.
 * 
 * The String will be reffered to as the 'key'
 * The int will be reffered to as the 'value'
